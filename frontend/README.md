# 🎯 Engineering Resource Management System (ERMS)

A modern, full-stack web application to manage engineers, projects, and assignments effectively, with role-based access, dashboards, and intelligent capacity tracking.

---

## 📋 Overview

The **Engineering Resource Management System (ERMS)** is built to streamline resource management in engineering organizations. It empowers teams to:

- 🔄 Assign engineers to projects and monitor workload  
- 📊 Visualize capacity and utilization via interactive dashboards  
- 🔐 Enforce secure, role-specific access for Admins, Managers, and Engineers  

This system was developed using modern technologies and enhanced through the support of **AI tools** including **ChatGPT**, **GitHub Copilot**, and **Grok (xAI)**—improving development speed, debugging, and documentation quality.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **🔍 Interactive Dashboards** – Visualize capacity using Chart.js  
- **🔒 Role-Based Access** – RBAC for Admin, Manager, Engineer roles  
- **📊 Capacity Tracking** – Monitor weekly availability and utilization  
- **🗕️ Assignment Management** – Assign engineers to projects and hours  
- **🔐 Secure Auth** – JWT-based authentication and hashed passwords
